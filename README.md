# SUPERHOT VR Universal Auto Splitter

## Summary

This is a program that will automatically handle splitting
a SUPERHOT VR Any% speedrun. Put as concretely as possible,
it will do its best to press a selected key whenever it
believes that the player has transitioned between notable
scenes.

## Usage

The program should be runnable as a simple .exe, for Windows
computers. This means go to Releases, download the most
current version, and run the appropriate executable.

If this process fails, then you can run the original Python.
Have Python installed (this program was written in Python 
3.6), and download the following dependencies using "pip 
install <dependency>": pyautogui, tkinter, pywin32. From
there, simply download this repository, and run the Python
script ImageRecAutoSplit.py.

For non-Windows computers, there is currently not support.
This program uses a Windows-based library in order to press
keys for splitting, so I do not believe it would work on
other OSes. It would probably be a fairly easy retrofit if
you yourself are a bit of a coder, but as of now and by means
there is only a Windows version available.
